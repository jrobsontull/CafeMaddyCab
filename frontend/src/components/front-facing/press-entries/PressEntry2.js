            Lately, Candy has been running to the bus stop on her way home from
            work. The 26 year-old dance instructor said it&apos;s usually dark
            outside by the time she finishes her shift at a studio in San
            Francisco â€” and she&apos;s started to dread commuting in the
            &quot;pitch black.&quot;<br></br>
            <br></br>&quot;I usually call my best friend who lives in New
            York,&quot; she said. &quot;I have him on the phone with me while I
            run to the bus stop and shiver, nervously waiting for the bus to
            come.&quot;<br></br>
            <br></br>Candy, who&apos;s Filipina American and asked that NPR not
            use her full name out of concern that she could be targeted, said
            the recent wave of anti-Asian violence around the Bay Area and
            elsewhere has made her fear for her own safety, especially when
            walking alone in the city.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Now, a new effort is helping to get her home safe.
